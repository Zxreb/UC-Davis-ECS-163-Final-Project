## Motivation
The primary objective of our project is to identify as well as communicate to the audience, particularly incoming college students, the student habits that are most significantly correlated with academic success. We aim to use accessible visualizations in order to illustrate how various daily behaviors can directly affect academic outcomes, helping students gain an understanding of these relationships and applying insights to their own lives.

We are currently utilizing the “Student Habits vs. Academic Performance” dataset from kaggle.com, which holds comprehensive data from 1,000 students. This includes various detailed metrics such as sleep duration, study hours, netflix viewing habits, class attendance, dietary habits, social media frequency, class attendance, and final exam scores. Due to the richness and variety of this dataset, this enables us to have multi-dimensional storytelling as well as demonstrate clear correlations between specific behaviors and academic performance.
