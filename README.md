## Description

The UC-Davis-ECS-163-Final-Project is an interactive data visualization slideshow that explores how various student habits affect academic performance. The primary objective of our project is to identify as well as communicate to the audience, particularly incoming college students, the student habits that are most significantly correlated with academic success. We aim to use accessible visualizations in order to illustrate how various daily behaviors can directly affect academic outcomes, helping students gain an understanding of these relationships and applying insights to their own lives. Using HTML, CSS, and D3.js (v7), the slideshow guides users through data insights derived from a Kaggle dataset of 1,000 students. Sleep, study time, attendance, social media use, and diet quality are visualized through histograms, scatter plots, radar charts, violin plots, and parallel coordinate plots. We strive to provide current and future students with information about which lifestyle patterns are most likely to influence test scores.

Clear visual transitions are controlled by modular D3 functions, allowing users to explore the project at their own pace. The main.js file contains all the visualization logic, while index.html structures the slideshow format and chart containers. Each visualization is dynamically based on the student_habits_performance.csv file. 

## Datset
We are currently utilizing the “Student Habits vs. Academic Performance” dataset from kaggle.com, which holds comprehensive data from 1,000 students. This includes various detailed metrics such as sleep duration, study hours, netflix viewing habits, class attendance, dietary habits, social media frequency, class attendance, and final exam scores. Due to the richness and variety of this dataset, this enables us to have multi-dimensional storytelling as well as demonstrate clear correlations between specific behaviors and academic performance.

## Instructions
First, make sure you have visual studio code downloaded on your local machine. Next, you want to clone into the github repository on VS Code on your local laptop. Next, make sure you have the "live server" extension enabled on VS Code. Once cloned into the repository, right click on the index.html file on the left and select the "run live server" option. The interactive slideshow should pop up and you should be able to learn some new things about student habits and the effect they can have on exam scores!
